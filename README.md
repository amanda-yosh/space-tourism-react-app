## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

The tools were chosen for personal reasons, such as training the use of Styled Components, and given the speed with which I was able to complete the challenge, given the short amount of time.
